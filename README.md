# Homebridge Bridge

This Homebridge plugin provides a modular interface to other programming languages.
It enables accessories to be controlled via a programming language other than TypeScript.

## Supported languages

Currently, the following languages are supported with helper classes provided:

- Python: [`pybridge`](https://github.com/homebridge-bridge/pybridge)

Due to the modular architecture any programming language can be added with ease.
See "[Adding a language](./docs/how-to.md#adding-support-for-a-programming-language)" for more information.

## Documentation

The documentation describing the architecture, API, how-tos and more can be found [here](./docs/).
